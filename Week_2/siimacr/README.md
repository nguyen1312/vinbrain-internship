The below pie chart illustrates the percentage of negative case (healthy) and positive case (unhealthy)

SIIM-ACR dataset has a skewed class distribution, most of the examples belong to class Non-Pneumothorax (healthy) (approximately 78%), with only a few examples in class Pneumothorax (unhealthy). So I know it's imbalanced.
